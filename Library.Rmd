>These posts are written by chatGPT based on a prompt where I have given it some code and asked it to explain a certain part of the code. Hopefully this will help me remember how to do stuff. While the other posts about R found [here](../code) are written by me, this is only a library of code I have used and maybe want to reuse sometime. (Of course it may be useful for other people as well, but that's not the main goal.)

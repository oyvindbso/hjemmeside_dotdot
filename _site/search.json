This page is\r\n            only used for my library of LLM-written\r\n            descriptions of my own code. I used to include it on my\r\n            main site but Google found it and demoted the whole\r\n            web-page. Accordingly, I moved it to a separate domain.\r\n            I am a Senior Research Fellow at The Institute for Social\r\n            Research (ISF) and the Centre\r\n            for Research on Civil Society and Voluntary Sector. My\r\n            research interests concern the the far right, social media,\r\n            terrorism, but also the Norwegian civil society. I study\r\n            Scandinavian right-wing extremism on social media as part of\r\n            the FREXO-project. In addition,\r\n            I was part of the research group at the Norwegian Holocaust\r\n            Center studying antisemitism\r\n            and islamophobia in Norway. In my PhD I studied how terrorist\r\n            attacks affect attitudes towards immigration and immigrants.\r\n            I have also worked for the secretary to valglovutvalget, the\r\n            Norwegian Election Act Commission, which presented its\r\n            report (NOU:2020:\r\n            6 Frie og hemmelige valg — Ny valglov) on May 27,\r\n            2020.\r\n          \r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n            \r\n              Øyvind Bugge Solheim\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      \r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      \r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      \r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      \r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      \r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      \r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      🤗\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                  \r\n              \r\n            \r\n            \r\n              My main homepage is found here.
